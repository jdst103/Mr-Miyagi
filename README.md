#Mr Miyagi

The program has programmed response depending on what the user is asking. The questions can be asked again until user wants to quit to which he can insert the required phrase to kill the program. Also created similar program using functions.

## Learning outcomes:
Git
Github
created README.md as markdown file.
Similar to exercise 108 and 107. Created a program to advice student. This involved using learning control flows and loops.


## INSTRUCTIONS:

Ask for user input and depending on the response, Mr Miyagi will respond.

Prompt user for input
Evaluate each input and print the appropriate responses
Follow these rules:

Every time you ask a question --> Mr. Miyagi respond with
--> 'questions are wise, but for now. Wax on, and Wax off!'
Every statement/question must start with Sensei, otherwise:
--> 'You are smart, but not wise - address me as Sensei please'
Every time you mention 'block' or 'blocking' --> Mr. Miyagi respond with
--> 'Remember, best block, not to be there..'
anything else you say:
--> 'do not lose focus. Wax on. Wax off.'

Make it so you keep playing until we say: 'Sensei, I am at peace'
=-> 'Sometimes, what heart know, head forget'
